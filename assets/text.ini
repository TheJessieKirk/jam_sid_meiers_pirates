; INI file for Pirates! Text System.
; Each group is a KEY to be used in strings for variable replacement.
; Each group must have a Type. The Type can be one of: __NUM, __STR,
; __INITIAL, __VAR, __GEN, __PER, __MALE, __FEMALE, __NEUTER, __MP,
; __FP, __NP, __SING, __PLUR.
;
; The __NUM type is used for numeric values. It will have 2 permutations:
; 1 and any other number.
;
; The __STR type should only be used for debugging purposes as translators
; have no way of knowing the value that will be substituted. It will have
; only 1 permutation (the variable, as is).
;
; The __CHAR type is similar to the __STR type but it is a single
; character. It will only have 1 permutation (the character, as is).
;
; The __VAR type is a lookup value. There must be at least one Value for
; these types. There will be 1 permutation for each listed Value. These
; types can also be linked so that multiple __VAR types will generate
; permutations to together. Links should be used whenever two __VAR types
; have the same number of values and will always be used with each other.
;
; The __GEN type is a string containing gender and plurality information.
; The string to be parsed must contain an FTextGenVarData object which
; contains the string, gender, and plurality, as the replacement value.
; These types will have 6 permutations (masculine, feminine, and neuter,
; both singular and plural).
;
; The __PER type is a subclass of the __GEN type used for a person's name.
; The string to be parsed must contain an FTextGenVarData object which
; contains the string and gender, as the replacement value. These types
; will have 2 permutations (masculine and feminine, both singular).
;
; The __MALE type is a subclass of the __GEN type. It is used for strings
; that will always be masculine singular. The string to be parsed must contain
; an FTextGenVarData object which contains the string, gender, and plurality,
; as the replacement value. There will only be 1 perumtation for this type.
;
; The __FEMALE type is a subclass of the __GEN type. It is used for strings
; that will always be feminine singular. The string to be parsed must contain
; an FTextGenVarData object which contains the string, gender, and plurality,
; as the replacement value. There will only be 1 perumtation for this type.
;
; The __NEUTER type is a subclass of the __GEN type. It is used for strings
; that will always be neuter singular. The string to be parsed must contain
; an FTextGenVarData object which contains the string, gender, and plurality,
; as the replacement value. There will only be 1 perumtation for this type.
;
; The __MP type is a subclass of the __GEN type. It is used for strings
; that will always be masculine plural. The string to be parsed must contain
; an FTextGenVarData object which contains the string, gender, and plurality,
; as the replacement value. There will only be 1 perumtation for this type.
;
; The __FP type is a subclass of the __GEN type. It is used for strings
; that will always be feminine plural. The string to be parsed must contain
; an FTextGenVarData object which contains the string, gender, and plurality,
; as the replacement value. There will only be 1 perumtation for this type.
;
; The __NP type is a subclass of the __GEN type. It is used for strings
; that will always be neuter plural. The string to be parsed must contain
; an FTextGenVarData object which contains the string, gender, and plurality,
; as the replacement value. There will only be 1 perumtation for this type.
;
; The __SING type is a subclass of the __GEN type. It is used for strings
; that will always be singular, but may be masculine, feminine, or neuter.
; The string to be parsed must contain an FTextGenVarData object which contains
; the string and gender as the replacement value. There will be 3 permutations
; for this type (masculine, feminine, and neuter).
;
; The __PLUR type is a subclass of the __GEN type. It is used for strings
; that will always be plural, but may be masculine, feminine, or neuter.
; The string to be parsed must contain an FTextGenVarData object which contains
; the string and gender as the replacement value. There will be 3 permutations
; for this type (masculine, feminine, and neuter).
