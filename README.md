## Settlement Names
***A Note on Archaic Spanish**: the names of many 16th-century Spanish settlements were originally written in Archaic Spanish (as Old Spanish transitioned to Modern Spanish). Archaic (ergo, authentic) spellings have been used when sources are available, but so far this has been done only once with the rendering of "Puerto Bello" as "Portobelo".*

*Florida Keys* is the name of the archipelago, but the main focus of European settlement from c. 1514 has been around *Key West*<sup>[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Keys)]</sup>, the Spanish name of which is Cayo Hueso<sup>[[Spanish Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayo_Hueso)]</sup>. The English name *Key West* would not have been widely used until the British occupation of 1763<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_West)]</sup>.

The settlement of *Gibraltar* was named *San Antonio de Gibraltar* when it was founded in 1592<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar,_Venezuela)]</sup>.

* Changed **San Juan** to **Puerto Rico de San Juan Bautista**.<br>
Confusingly, *San Juan Bautista* was the European name for the island since 1493, and the settlement itself was referred to variously as *Puerto Rico* (the name of the bay the settlement was in) and *San Juan* (the name of the entire island) from its founding in 1511. It was formally named **Puerto Rico de San Juan Bautista* in 1521. This was commonly abbreviated to *San Juan*, and all this led to such confusion that by 1746 the names of the settlement and island had reversed (with the island named *Puerto Rico* and the settlement's formal name mapped as *Puerto Rico de Puerto Rico*, but usually referred to as *San Juan*. This was the settlement's *de facto* name by the American occupation of 1898<sup>[[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico)]</sup>.
